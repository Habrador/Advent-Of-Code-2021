# Advent Of Code 2021

Advent of code (https://adventofcode.com) is a coding challenge where you solve one puzzle every day in December. It's like a chocolate calender but without the chocolate! 2021 was the first year I participated in the challenge and I made it all with Unity!

Collected 36 stars!
